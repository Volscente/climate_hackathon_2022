- carbon dioxide (CO2)
- methane (CH4)
- nitrous oxide (N2O)
- hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
- perfluorocarbons (PFCs)

- 12 Bioclimatic variables


## NSIDC - Daily Sea Ice Extent Data
The dataset collects information about snow, ice, glaciers, frozen ground and climate interacitons
that make up Earth's cryosphere. It shows its extension, divided by hemisphere, over the
period 1978 - 2019.
